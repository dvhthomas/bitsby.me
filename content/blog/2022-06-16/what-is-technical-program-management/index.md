    Technical program management is a pretty slippery thing to define.
    Especially because it varies depending on where you practice it.
    I attempt to define it in a way that works for me.

I have done three jobs over the past 15 years that had the title of program manager and
technical program manager: Microsoft, Google, and more recently, GitHub.
And even before that, after I wrapped up my illustrious career as a practicing
software engineer, I was a project manager.
So it's a theme for me.

> Note: I'll use the abbreviations PgM for program manager, PjM for project manager,
and TPM for technical program manager.

But to be completely and brutally honest, I haven't ever had to explain what I
do quite a much as I have at GitHub.
TPM is a relatively new discipline at GitHub (less than two years old as of early 2022),
and with that comes a predictable need to describe what a TPM is, and what a TPM does.

With those conversations I've sharpened my own working definition that seems to land
reasonably well with my peers, even if the details still tend to take more time
to 

At each one the definition of 

### Have a plan

### Seek the risk

### Handle the suprises

### Continuously improve
