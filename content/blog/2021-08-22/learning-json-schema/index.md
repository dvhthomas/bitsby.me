## Why JSON Schema?

The most basic reason for defining a schema is to created a shared understanding of what is considered acceptable between two systems.
If I am calling an API or making a remote procedure call (RPC) then it saves everyone a whole lot of hassle if we agree on what the remote system is equipped to handle.

### An aside on Data vs. API

To be crystal clear I **am not** talking about an API definition here.
In that case I'd probably be writing about [OpenAPI](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) which is governed by the [OpenAPI Initiative](https://www.openapis.org/).
_That_ is about building APIs in a schema-first way.

Since I _am_ primarily concerned with a data schema and _am not_ the API used to work with that data schema, then Open API is just not the right tool.

Think about Microsoft Excel files.

I don't need to specify _how_ the application (Open Office or Microsoft Excel or Apple Numbers) will consume via their own internal 'API'.
But I _do_ care deeply that the data structure of the Excel file format is extremely well documented and consistent.

What-not-how is a helpful way---for me at least---to decide when to use OpenAPI (how and what) vs. JSON Schema (just what).

That's what I am working on right now: more of a file format or standard data interchange specification.
So JSON Schema fits and Open API does not.

(Even then, Open API does advertise itself as JSON Schema compatible. That's not strictly true today but there's ongoing work to get there.)

To look at a simple OpenAPI schema, check out [World Time API](http://worldtimeapi.org/pages/schema).

### Back to the 'what' of JSON Schema

So I need to define a data format (or if you prefer, a message or payload format) so that two or more systems can agree that the data is either compatible with said schema, or not compatible.

What are the options? (spoiler: JSON Schema is a pretty good option!)

#### XML a.k.a. 'angle brackets'

Back in the old days ('naught-ies' and twenty-teens) this would have been done using an [XML Schema Definition (XSD)](https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema11-1/) document.
But in the 2020s JavaScript rules and JSON is the _lingua franca_ of the computer systems everyone, so JSON it is.

There's nothing inherently wrong with XML, but it is pretty verbose, and given that JSON Schema basically _is_ JSON with some rules, it's generally a lot less effort than 'parsing angle brackets'.

But not so fast.
Even today there are widespread and viable alternatives.

#### Protocol Buffers a.k.a C-if-you-squint-a-bit

Top of mind for me is probably [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers).
It's not like I was doing this hands-on when I was at Google, but I certainly came across `*.proto` or `*.pb` files aplenty.

And 'protos' are really prevalent as a way to describe highly efficient binary messages payloads in RPC systems.
They are strongly typed and take versioning seriously, plus there's support for composition once you start needing reuse.

So why not use protobufs?
We've had some recent experience on my team working with protobufs in purely client-side code and it just seemed pretty heavy and 'non-obvious' for the JavaScript or TypeScript environment.

I will say, thought, that the `protoc` ability to [generated JavaScript RPC client libraries from protobuf files](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/javascript-generated) is pretty sweet.

#### ServiceStack for the .NET crowd

Another aside: I wouldn't generally start with a .NET toolkit these days.
Nothing wrong with .NET at all and most of my heavy programming was with C#.
However, most engineers we work with already have a JavaScript compiler on their machine and most do not have .NET.
Simple as that.

But...the strong opinion in the entire ServiceStack framework is that of 'message-first' development.
And if you read even the slightest bit of their [ethos around using data transfer objects (DTOs)](https://docs.servicestack.net/why-remote-services-use-dtos), you quickly see the Martin Fowler influence.
And I personally like that influence for the clarity it brings to system integration.

In addition, they have a similar approach to Protocol Buffers for generating [client libraries](https://docs.servicestack.net/clients-overview) for mutiple languages.
So while this is not a good fit for my current team based on using stuff they already use, Service Stack is one to keep an eye on.

Now where was I...?

Right: JSON Schema as a way to define messages/DTOs/data structures.

## Learning resources

- [Official JSON Schema getting started guide](https://json-schema.org/learn/getting-started-step-by-step.html) is predictably good.
  The sample schemas and how they relate to each other made the URI reference approach really click.
- [Opis JSON Schema](https://opis.io/json-schema/2.x/). This is a PHP implementation so the language itself wasn't helpful.
  However, the documentation is incredible.
  For example the [`oneOf`](https://opis.io/json-schema/2.x/multiple-subschemas.html#oneof) sub-schema examples were a real 'Aha!' moment for me.
- [Pydantic JSON Schema code generation](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/schema/). As we'll see in a minute, this turned out to be the golden ticket for me.

## Starting with Python

JSON itself is incredibly easy to understand.
Almost the entire specification is [captured in a few syntax diagrams](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).
But that's a far cry from understanding how to defined entire data models in JSON using a set of schema specification rules.
It's kind of like knowing how to spell words in English, then assuming you should 'just' understand the rules to writing a sonnet using the Shakespearean form.

I read the JSON Schema official guide and that got me oriented.
But I come more from a strongly typed (C#, Java, Go) background, and more recently Python.
So the examples, while helpful, were in the language of JSON Schema.

Because of that learning bias, I needed to start with, say, Python and model the schema using a language that comes naturally to me.
With that done, I could then see what resulting JSON Schema would look like if I code-generated the JSON from the Python.

### Pydantic

OK so Python to start.
I didn't have to look far to find a Pythonic library that has strong typing and static type checking: [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/schema/).


Here's what that looks like.
First note the imports.
Pydantic gives us a lot of helpers like `conint` meaning a 'constrained integer`.
Think, 'minimum value', 'maximum value', etc.

{{% code file="pydantic.py" lang="python" %}}


Now, most of this is just straight up Python classes, Pydantic base classes and helpers, and then my specific schema types.

Some highlights:

- I use `SketchBase` to plug in a consistent way to name the output JSON schema types in a `camel_case_format` like a JSON-consumer might expect.
- `Enums` are really easy to define. No need to integer types masquerading as strings.
- `PageCoordinate` shows how I ensure that page coordinates are always positive integers.
- `Note` shows the use of `PageCoordinate` as a reference type, plus the `Config > schema_extras` to drop an example in there.


All in all I found Pydantic to have a low bar to entry into JSON Schema for someone most comfortable with Python.

### Human readable documentation

{{% code file="schema_docs.py" lang="python" %}}

I just stick this into a `Makefile` so I can run it for multiple schemas if needed:

{{% code file="Makefile" lang="make" %}}

And that gives me a nice way to spit out some HTML to look at:

```sh
‚ùØ make
python3 docs/schema_docs.py --schema data
Created output/data.html...
Created output/data.md...
python3 docs/schema_docs.py --schema config
Created output/config.html...
Created output/config.md...
```

Tada!
We have a nice portable HTML version:

{{< figure src="human-docs.png" title="Human readable documentation" >}}

And drilling in to a single type called...`type`...there's all the info I might need as a consumer.

{{< figure src="type-detail.png" title="One type with detailed description and the enumeration info." >}}

## JSON Schema in...JSON Schema

After a fair amount of munging around with Pydantic I felt like I couldn't quite express some of the nuances I was reading about in the JSON Schema specs and docs.

For example, getting Python/Pydantic classes just so to produce polymorphic types had me scratching my head.
Specifically, I needed something akin to a set of attribute records associated with a graphic in a sketch (data behind the picture).
And those 'data columns' could be one of a subset of valid JSON Schema types.
With that, and a few other needs like proper references _between_ JSON Schemas, I decided to start from scratch by _very carefully_ hand crafting the JSON Schema from scratch, directly in a `*.json` file.

> Cue maddening indentation woes and mismatched curly braces and the usual missing comma shenanigans that comes with JSON and JavaScript in general.

### Defining reusable types

Once I got in the groove there were some nice wins.
For example, I could use regular expressions to tightly define how colors should be stored:

```js
definitions: {
    ...lots more definitions...
  "rgbHexColor": {
    "title": "RGB color in hexadecimal",
    "description": "A three or six character representation of an RGB value in hexadecimal.",
    "type": "string",
    "pattern": "^#([\\da-fA-F]{3}){1,2}$",
    "examples": [
      "#ffffff",
      "#fff"
    ]
  },
  ...and more still...
}
```

And by putting that  in the `definitions` section of the schema I could reuse that throughout. Nice!

And my polymorphic example was pretty easy too.
But there's a fair bit going on in here.

```js
"attributes": {
  "type": "array",
  "title": "Attributes",
  "description": "Generic collection of zero or more attributes with a key and value",
  "items": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "key": {
        "type": "string",
        "minLength": 1
      },
      "value": {
        "type": [
          "string",
          "number",
          "object",
          "boolean",
          "array"
        ]
      }
    },
    "required": [
      "key",
      "value"
    ],
    "additionalProperties": false
  }
}
```

- It's an array, so zero or more repeating objects representing data behind each graphic in the drawing.
- The items are `object` types consisting of a `key` and a `value`.
- The `key` must be a string of _at least 1 character in length.
- The value can only be one of a specific set of types.
- Both the `key` and the `value` are required.
- You _cannot_ add additional properties onto the key/value pairs.

That last one was really not obvious to me at first.
I mean, it's self evident when you read it, but until I saw the HTML docs it did not quite compute.
To whit: in JSON Schema by default you **can add any random property you like onto any specified object in the schema**.
In other words, you can throw random data into your carefully craft JSON Schema and WHOOSH! there goes your easily parse data file.

I quickly got into the habit of setting `additionalProperties: false` by default just to avoid hiccups like that.

### References are DRY

Taking the `definition` concept further are including other schemas by reference.
Here is the `vector` type pointing to a bunch of `definitions` inline:

```js
"vector": {
  "type": "object",
  "additionalProperties": false,
  "required": [
    "origin",
    "commands"
  ],
  "properties": {
    "origin": {
      "description": "The origin point for a drawing command is very similar to the [move](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Paths#line_commands) command in SVG: it's like positioning your pen on the page _ready_ to draw. So the `origin` is the first coordinate of any subsequent sequence of drawing commands.",
      "$ref": "#/definitions/point-2d"
    },
    "commands": {
      "title": "Sketching commands",
      "description": "Following the spirit of standards like HTML Canvas and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), sketch describe commands to draw elements on the page rather than describing the geometry itself. For example, rather than define a line as two coordinate pairs (start and end), the `line` command assumes that and existing starting point exists, and its job is to 'draw a straight line to the end point`.",
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "oneOf": [
          {
            "$ref": "#/definitions/styledLine"
          },
          {
            "$ref": "#/definitions/styledArc"
          }
        ]
      }
    },
```

But in the `config.schema.json` file which sits next to the other JSON Schema files on disk we see a different pattern:

```js
"capabilities": {
    "title": "Capabilities",
    "description": "Collection of zero or more capabilities that control how data in a sketch should be interpreted, and how a sketch app might decide which user-facing tools are available to edit a specific SDS document, and more significantly, how to interpret `sketches` values for application-level correctness.",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "paging": {
        "$ref": "capability.schema.json#/definitions/pagingCapability"
      },
      "outbuildings": {
        "$ref": "capability.schema.json#/definitions/outbuildingCapability"
      },
      "arcDrawing": {
        "$ref": "capability.schema.json#/definitions/arcDrawing"
      },
      "boundaryConstraints": {
        "$comment": "This was previously a setting called `boundaryScale` which was either `true` or `false`. The new name better describes the impact of setting the `constrainedBoundary` value.",
        "$ref": "capability.schema.json#/definitions/constrainedBoundary"
      },
      "colorCustomization": {
        "$ref": "capability.schema.json#/definitions/colorCustomization"
      },
```

Note the inclusion of the local file name then a JSONPath specification for where to find a type by reference using the `$ref` attribute.

## Summary

So that's it for my first foray.
The schemas are actually public but are obfuscated behind a wonky URL for now.
I learned a lot that I didn't have time to write up yet, like generating strongly typed client libraries and type definitions for TypeScript.
But I'll save that for another day.
