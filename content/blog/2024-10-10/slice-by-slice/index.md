## An exciting day

"Work the problem" and "Slice by slice".

I distinctly remember those two things that two different people told me in moments of personal crisis and pressure.
Today was one of those reasonably 'exciting' days at work that makes me think about those phrases once again ðŸ˜…

## Work the problem

> "Stop creating pressure, Dylan. Work the problem."

I didn't actually know at the time that this was an homage to something that NASA flight director Gene Kranz said during the fateful flight of Apollo 13.
And I wasn't exactly trying to rescue a space mission!
But I was in a novel situation that had, for me, serious professional consequences.

This German software engineer told me to 'work the problem' late at night in a parking lot on the Google campus where yet another build of Android Auto just would not work.
I was really frustrated and really stressed by a very public looming deadline.
But the statement completely stopped me in my tracks.
As much for the calm demeanor of someone who has seen it all as the words themselves.
I just stared at him and let the depth of that infuriatingly simple statement sink in.

I still think about him and his advice often when I'm starting to spin.
I go right back to that passenger seat in a car with a bunch of wiring and hardware on my lap wonder what the heck was going wrong.
What is known? What is not known? What will probably advance us?
What will feel like I'm making a difference but is ultimately just directionless churn?
Who can help? Who cannot help?

Cool it, and work the problem.

## Slice by Slice

> "Slice by slice, Dylan."

What is it with German automotive software engineers?!
This came from a very senior technologist who I deeply admire and respect, who probably doesn't even remember working with me.
C'est la vie.
But that phrase is deeply embedded in my brain.
Another car, another frustration, another chunk of self-doubt that I couldn't or wouldn't figure it all out.
Then this sage guru of Not Getting Flustered just said: "Slice by slice, Dylan".
Dammit!!!! What the heck did that mean?!

Of course it just means 'step by step'.
Take it one logical step at a time.
Formulate a hypothesis; test it; learn from the data; adjust; repeat.
Yep: he described the scientific method and how to solve problems in three words.

And just to be clear: I'm fine; it's fine.
Yes, it was an 'exciting' day today.
But that's when I remind myself: "Stop creating pressure, Dylan. Work the problem." And: "Slice by slice."
