## Pangeo

I'm researching a variety of open source approaches and tools to support large scale scientific modeling and the data issues that come with it.
Think multi-TB model outputs, and standardized formats like netCDF.

Nate told me about [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/#what-is-pangeo) from his time at NCAR.
I read a boatload of docs and watched a great introductory video from 2018.

### Reasons

Problems it solves are:

- Common data model for accessing data science-y/geosciene-y data like netCDF, GeoTIFF, and more.
  The use of [Zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#) is interesting here as a R/W option for [`$X$array`](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/).
- Moving compute and simulation (the running of numerical models) closer to the data, which at this point is too big to move.
- Ties to the existing data science toolkit, e.g., Python, NumPy, Dask.
One element of the work is to move lots of data from machines in a cluster spitting out model output (think SAN or even attached SSD), and get it somewhere more useful for downstream scientists and other users.


## Pangeo Forge

One of the issues to solve is how to transform data from formats like netCDF into Zarr in a more pre-defined way.
Turns out that the Pangeo team have a [new project roadmap](https://medium.com/pangeo/pangeo-2-0-2bedf099582d) defined for [Pangeo Forge](https://pangeo-forge.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

It takes the guesswork out of ETL for earth science data using an approach similar to 'recipes' used in [Conda Forge](https://conda-forge.org).
This diagram really says it all ([source](https://github.com/pangeo-forge/roadmap/blob/master/pangeo-forge-diagram.png)):

## Prefect

Looking around the source code I saw that Pangeo Forge will be using a project called [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/core).
It's highly reminiscent of [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org) in terms of workflow definition and execution.
And then it becomes really clear that the Prefect folks know and love Airflow a lot, but have [reasons for not using it](https://medium.com/the-prefect-blog/why-not-airflow-4cfa423299c4).

> "...Airflow’s applicability is limited by its legacy as a monolithic batch scheduler aimed at data engineers principally concerned with orchestrating third-party systems employed by others in their organizations."

Intrigued that the deployment story is to a Dask cluster or via Kubernetes.
I'll not dig in unless I need to, but happy to find another modern DAG-based workflow automation system/platform/tool.
