## Problem - unhappy Python

I was setting up a new Ubuntu machine today and was using `asdf` to get me there.
`asdf install python 3.9.5` complained that various dependencies for Python extensions like bz2 and OpenSSL were missing.

```sh
sdf install python 3.9.5
python-build 3.9.5 /home/dylan/.asdf/installs/python/3.9.5
Downloading Python-3.9.5.tar.xz...
-> https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.5/Python-3.9.5.tar.xz

WARNING: The Python bz2 extension was not compiled. Missing the bzip2 lib?
WARNING: The Python readline extension was not compiled. Missing the GNU readline lib?
ERROR: The Python ssl extension was not compiled. Missing the OpenSSL lib?

Please consult to the Wiki page to fix the problem.

## Solution - Install prerequisite build tools

After some digging I found the following combination to get me over the hump:

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev \
  zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev \
  libsqlite3-dev llvm libncurses5-dev \
  libncursesw5-dev wget curl
```

With that in place this completed successfully:

```sh
$ asdf install python 3.9.5
python-build 3.9.5 /home/dylan/.asdf/installs/python/3.9.5
