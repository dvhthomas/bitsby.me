### Head of Partner Engineers, Android Automotive --- _2014-2018_

- **Leadership.** Founding team member 2014, global lead from 2015. I built and led a global hybrid remote team of 15+ technical staff. We got [Android Auto](https://www.android.com/auto/) embedded and shipping with 75+ industry partners in 130+ head unit variants in the first 24 months.
- **Global technology partnerships.** Fully accountable for the first global Android automotive engineering partnerships with most OEMs and their entire Tier 1 supply chains. Influencing platform and hardware/software roadmaps across an industry.
-  **Scaling technical delivery.** Formulated the reproducible certification process applicable to all partners and internal teams, thus scaling certification throughput. This ultimately led me to start a 3rd Party Labs ("3PL") outsourced certification program to dramatically increase the reach of the product.
-  **Technical thought leadership.** The auto industry has a strong driver safety focus, leading to numerous one-off conversations with Android UX and PM. I codified those nascent discussions into an unambiguous, holistic spec using clear [RFC2119-style](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) language.
-  **Technical clarity.** Led and contributed to an effort to clarify the Android Auto protocol-level integration spec resulting in: an improved test suite to cover all `MUST` cases; greater clarity for all engineers integrating Android Auto into their head units.
-  **Corporate citizenship.** Sat on TPM hiring committee reviewing 50+ candidate packages for hire/no hire decisions, and personally interviewed 70+ technical and non-technical candidates.

### Google Maps Program Manager --- _2012-2014_
