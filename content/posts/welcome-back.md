## After a long pause

According to my records...let me see now...it's been six years
since I last posted anything to any blog, let alone this one.

Since then I've done a fair amount in life, mostly while working
at Google on the Android Automotive team as the head of their partner
engineering team. Learned a few things there.

But now I'm out of the San Francisco Bay Area and back in the middle-ish
of the United States, and doing other tech stuff of the cloud-y variety.

Over those years I never did find much of a non-work creative outlet.
Facebook sucks so I un-joined. I discovered that Twitter ([here I am](https://twitter.com/dvhthomas)) works relatively well
for me as a consumer, but I never wrote much on it. So it's been rather quiet, apart from the odd post on LinkedIn ([me again](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylan-thomas/)). And zero on the public coding
side of things other than the [odd tweak to my dot files](https://github.com/dvhthomas/dotfiles).

## I'm blogging again

In short, I have things to share again--possibly mostly for my future self
if I'm being honest--so I'm restarting my blog. That'd be the one you reading now. Very exciting for you, I'm sure!

See you soon. And hopefully a little more frequently.
