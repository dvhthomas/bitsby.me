Reposting a blog I wrote for [Woolpert](https://www.woolpert.com) on how to proceed with a cloud strategy. I focus mostly on the _Decide_ phase, since that's most interesting to me personally, and I think it's also the part where a lack of recognition of an appropriate mindset gets people in a pickle.
